Reading, manipulating and viewing EEG data from the Brainvision Brainamp system

(hopefully soon EDF as well)

It's my first project in rust and I would estimate that >90% of the code is human written.

LLMs were only used for queries when I absolutley got stuck at for example trying to parse binary data which I have never done before. I am aiming for 100% human generated code base when I get better since I really do not their output.
